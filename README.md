Add a product: Input details such as name, price, type (fruit or vegetable).

Search the catalog: Find products based on a keyword, with an option to calculate and display prices.

Browse the catalog: Navigate through product categories and types.

Remove a product: Delete a product by name.

The program employs an Object-Oriented approach with the "Product" class, utilizing ArrayLists for storage. The console menu ensures user-friendly interaction, and input validation handles incorrect entries. This application provides a simple yet effective solution for managing grocery inventory.
